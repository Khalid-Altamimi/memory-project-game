As a user, I want to flip two cards at a time to find matching pairs so that I can challenge my memory and complete the game efficiently. AS a user the game should display a shuffled grid of face-down cards, As a user with each image appearing exactly twice. As a user when I flip two cards, they stay face-up if they match or flip back after a short delay if they don’t. As a user the game should track my number of moves, and end when all pairs are matched. As a user after completion, I should see a “Play Again” button to reset and start a new round with shuffled cards.

// Initialize the game:
// - Create a list of card images, with each image appearing exactly twice
// - Shuffle the list of cards randomly
// - Display all cards face-down in a grid layout
// On card click:
// - If the card is already matched or already face-up, ignore the click
// - If they do not match:
// - Wait a short delay (1 second)
// - Flip both cards back face-down
// - Reset firstCard and secondCard to null
// On "Play Again" button click:
// - Reset game state (matched pair count, score)
// - Shuffle and reinitialize the grid of cards
// - Start a new game
